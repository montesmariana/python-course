Just for practice, add `import argparse` to the top of your script and in the end add the code in @lst-arguments.\n\n```{#lst-arguments .python lst-cap=\"Argparse code for a script.\"}\nparser = argparse.ArgumentParser(\"docstrings\")\nparser.add_argument(\"name\", type=str, help=\"Name of the person to greet\")\nparser.add_argument(\"--age\", type=int, default = 25, help=\"Age of the person before their birthday.\")\nargs = parser.parse_args()\nprsn = Person(args.name, args.age)\nprsn.greet()\nprsn.birthday()\n```\n\n# What to do in VS Code\n\n[Last class](2023-03-14-files.qmd) we used some functions created before and applied them to a dictionary read from a file.\n\nThis time, instead, we will read the same contents from [a file](_resources/books.json) but instead of using the functions we will create instances of the `Book` and `DiscWorldBook` classes defined in the slides.\n\nThe first step is to load the libraries.\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=1}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nimport json # to read the json\nfrom datetime import date # to find out the current year\n```\n:::\n\n\nAfterwards we can define our classes.\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=2}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nclass Book:\n    language = \"English\"\n\n    def __init__(self, title, author, year):\n        self.title = title\n        self.author = author\n        self.year = year\n        \n        this_year = date.today().year\n        self.age = this_year - self.year\n\n        self.characters = set()\n\n    def get_age(self):\n        if self.age < 0:\n            return f\"This book will be published in {-self.age} years.\"\n        else:\n            return f\"This book is {self.age} years old.\"\n\n    def add_character(self, name):\n        self.characters.add(name)\n\n    def __str__(self):\n        sent_1 = f\"{self.title} was written by {self.author} in {self.language}.\"\n        sent_2 = f\"It was published in {self.year}, that is, {self.age} years ago.\"\n        if len(self.characters) > 0:\n            sent_3 = f\"The main characters are: {', '.join(self.characters)}.\"\n        else:\n            sent_3 = \"\"\n        return \"\\n\".join([sent_1, sent_2, sent_3])\n\nclass DiscWorldBook(Book):\n    series = \"Discworld\"\n\n    def __init__(self, title, year):\n        super().__init__(title, \"Terry Pratchett\", year)\n        self.subseries = \"\"\n\n    def set_subseries(self, subseries):\n        self.subseries = subseries\n    \n    def __str__(self):\n        parent = super().__str__()\n        if self.subseries:\n            return parent + f'\\nThis book belongs to the \"{self.subseries}\" subseries of {self.series}.'\n        else:\n            return parent\n```\n:::\n\n\nNext we can read the json file.\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=3}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nbooks_file = '_resources/books.json'\nwith open(books_file, encoding = 'utf-8') as f:\n    books = json.load(f)\nlen(books)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display execution_count=7}\n```\n6\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe output is a list with small dictionaries, each of which has the following keys: \"title\", \"author\", \"year\", \"language\" and \"main_characters\".
