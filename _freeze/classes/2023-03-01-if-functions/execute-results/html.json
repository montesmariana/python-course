You can also write down extra notes as markdown and experiment with the different variable types.\n\n# What to do in VS Code\n\n[Last class](2023-02-21-variables.qmd) we created a dictionary with information about a book and wrote some text that uses that variable. I reproduce the dictionary below with a different name:\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=1}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nhat_sky = {\n    'title' : 'A hat full of sky',\n    'author' : 'Terry Pratchett',\n    'year' : 2004,\n    'language' : 'English',\n    'main_characters' : [\n        'Tiffany Aching',\n        'Granny Weatherwax',\n        'Rob Anybody'\n        ]\n}\n```\n:::\n\n\nNow we'll create similar dictionaries for other books:\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=2}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nsmall_gods = {\n    'title' : 'Small gods',\n    'author' : 'Terry Pratchett',\n    'year' : 1992,\n    'language' : 'English',\n    'main_characters' : [\n        'Om',\n        'Brutha'\n        ]\n}\ncolor_magic = {\n    'title' : 'The color of magic',\n    'author' : 'Terry Pratchett',\n    'year' : 1983,\n    'language' : 'English',\n    'main_characters' : [\n        'Rincewind',\n        'Twoflower'\n        ]\n}\nshepherd_crown = {\n    'title' : \"The shepherd's crown\",\n    'author' : 'Terry Pratchett',\n    'year' : 2015,\n    'language' : 'English',\n    'main_characters' : [\n        'Tiffany Aching',\n        'Nightshade',\n        'Peaseblossom'\n        ]\n}\n```\n:::\n\n\nFinally, we'll create a list with our books:\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=3}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\ndiscworld_sample = [color_magic, small_gods, hat_sky, shepherd_crown]\n```\n:::\n\n\nWe will then reuse the code of the strings from last class inside a for loop that goes through each of the books.\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=4}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nfor book in discworld_sample:\n    sent_1 = f\"{book['title'].title()} was written by {book['author'].title()} in {book['language']}.\"\n    sent_2 = f\"It was published in {book['year']}, that is, {2023-book['year']} years ago.\"\n    sent_3 = f\"The main characters are: {', '.join(book['main_characters'])}.\"\n    book_description = \" \".join([sent_1, sent_2, sent_3])\n    print(book_description)\n    print()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nThe Color Of Magic was written by Terry Pratchett in English.
