Today we learn about [docstrings and argparse](../slides/documentation.qmd){target="_blank"}:

- Documenting functions and classes with docstrings
- Creating scripts that take arguments with `argparse`
- Running vs importing scripts

# What to do during the class

- For the "docstrings" section:

    + Follow along the presentation and copy (or rewrite) the code in your Jupyter Notebook.

    + Then copy the documented functions to a ".py" file in VS Code.

- For the `argparse` section:

    + Not all the code can be run in Jupyter notebook. Just for practice, add `import argparse` to the top of your script and in the end add the code in @lst-arguments.

```{#lst-arguments .python lst-cap="Argparse code for a script."}
parser = argparse.ArgumentParser("docstrings")
parser.add_argument("name", type=str, help="Name of the person to greet")
parser.add_argument("--age", type=int, default = 25, help="Age of the person before their birthday.")
args = parser.parse_args()
prsn = Person(args.name, args.age)
prsn.greet()
prsn.birthday()
```

# Final exercise

For your assignment, you wrote a Jupyter notebook documenting some class definitions, exemplifying them and running them. Use the same contents but change the format:

- Document your class and function definitions with docstrings.

- Move them to a script.

- Add a description to the script itself as a docstring.

- Import `argparse` (at the beginning of your script) and, at the end, add an `if __name__ == '__main__':` section in which you run the final code of your notebook based on the appropriate arguments.

    + Crucially, the name of the file you need to open.

    + Optionally, an argument that returns a list of items to select from your list of dictionaries (you can combine `nargs` and `choices`!).

- In your Jupyter Notebook:

    + Import your script and try checking the documentation of your classes / functions.
    
    + Exemplify your classes like you did before, but using them as imported from the script. (Don't forget to prefix the class name with the script name!)

    + Run your script with `%run` and the appropriate arguments.
