Today we learn about [iterables](../slides/iterables.qmd){target="_blank"}:

- Going through each element of a list or a dictionary.
- Combining lists.
- Generators.

# What to do in Jupyter

Follow along the presentation and copy (or rewrite) the code in your Jupyter Notebook. You can also write down extra notes as markdown and experiment with the different variable types.

## Think about

- How do you think you could use a list or a dictionary in translation?

# What to do in VS Code

[Last class](2023-02-21-variables.qmd) we created a dictionary with information about a book and wrote some text that uses that variable. I reproduce the dictionary below with a different name:

```{python}
hat_sky = {
    'title' : 'A hat full of sky',
    'author' : 'Terry Pratchett',
    'year' : 2004,
    'language' : 'English',
    'main_characters' : [
        'Tiffany Aching',
        'Granny Weatherwax',
        'Rob Anybody'
        ]
}
```

Now we'll create similar dictionaries for other books:

```{python}
small_gods = {
    'title' : 'Small gods',
    'author' : 'Terry Pratchett',
    'year' : 1992,
    'language' : 'English',
    'main_characters' : [
        'Om',
        'Brutha'
        ]
}
color_magic = {
    'title' : 'The color of magic',
    'author' : 'Terry Pratchett',
    'year' : 1983,
    'language' : 'English',
    'main_characters' : [
        'Rincewind',
        'Twoflower'
        ]
}
shepherd_crown = {
    'title' : "The shepherd's crown",
    'author' : 'Terry Pratchett',
    'year' : 2015,
    'language' : 'English',
    'main_characters' : [
        'Tiffany Aching',
        'Nightshade',
        'Peaseblossom'
        ]
}
```

Finally, we'll create a list with our books:

```{python}
discworld_sample = [color_magic, small_gods, hat_sky, shepherd_crown]
```

We will then reuse the code of the strings from last class inside a for loop that goes through each of the books.

```{python}
for book in discworld_sample:
    sent_1 = f"{book['title'].title()} was written by {book['author'].title()} in {book['language']}."
    sent_2 = f"It was published in {book['year']}, that is, {2023-book['year']} years ago."
    sent_3 = f"The main characters are: {', '.join(book['main_characters'])}."
    book_description = " ".join([sent_1, sent_2, sent_3])
    print(book_description)
    print()
```
