Today we learn about [files](../slides/files/index.qmd){target="_blank"}:

- Download a file based on the URL with `requests`
- HTML file structure and `bs4`
- Regular expressions with `re`
- Dataframes with `pandas`
- JSON files
- `OSError`, `try` and `except`

# What to do in Jupyter

Follow along the presentation and copy (or rewrite) the code in your Jupyter Notebook. You can also write down extra notes as markdown and experiment with the different variable types.

# What to do in VS Code

[Last class](2023-03-07-if-functions.qmd) we created a function to work on a list of dictionaries.

```{python}
def check_book(book):
    # check that the input is a dictionary
    if type(book) != dict:
        raise TypeError("Please provide a dictionary!")
    
    # check that the dict has the right keys

    for key in ['title', 'author', 'language', 'year', 'main_characters']:
        if not key in book:
            raise KeyError(f"'{key}' is missing from the dictionary!")
        # check the types
        if key == 'year':
            if type(book[key]) != int:
                raise TypeError(f"The year should be an integer!")
        elif key == "main_characters":
            if type(book[key]) != list:
                raise TypeError(f"The main characters should be provided as a list!")
        elif type(book[key]) != str:
            raise TypeError(f"The {key} should be a string!")
    return

def describe_book(book):
    # check that the input is correct
    check_book(book)

    sent_1 = f"{book['title'].title()} was written by {book['author'].title()} in {book['language']}."
    sent_2 = f"It was published in {book['year']}, that is, {2023-book['year']} years ago."
    sent_3 = f"The main characters are: {', '.join(book['main_characters'])}."
    book_description = "\n".join([sent_1, sent_2, sent_3])
    print(book_description)
```

Rewrite the script so that, instead of defining the contents of the dictionary manually, it reads them from a JSON file.
You can also write another script that has the contents and _writes_ them to the JSON file.
